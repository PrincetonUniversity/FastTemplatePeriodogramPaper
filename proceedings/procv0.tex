\abstract{%
  This proceedings presents a novel, non-linear extension to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram that allows periodograms to be generated
  for arbitrary signal shapes. Such periodograms are already known as "template periodograms" or "periodic matched filters," but 
  current implementations are computationally inefficient. The "fast template periodogram" presented here improves existing techniques
  by a factor of $\sim$a few for small test cases ($\bigO(10)$ observations), and over three orders of magnitude for lightcurves containing
  $\bigO(10^4)$ observations. The fast template periodogram scales asymptotically as $\bigO(HN_f\log HN_f + H^4N_f)$, where
  $H$ denotes the number of harmonics required to adequately approximate the template and $N_f$ is the number of trial
  frequencies. Existing implementations scale as $\bigO(N_{\rm obs}N_f)$, where $N_{\rm obs}$ is the number of
  observations in the lightcurve. An open source Python implementation is available on GitHub.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Template fitting, or periodic matched filtering, is a powerful technique for identifying, classifying, and characterizing
periodic variability in noisy time series data. However, template fitting requires several orders of magnitude more computational
resources than running a Lomb Scargle periodogram \cite{Lomb_1976,Scargle_1982,Barning_1963,Vanicek_1971} on the same lightcurve, 
and the computational requirements scale as $N_{\rm obs}N_f$, where $N_{\rm obs}$ is the number of observations in the 
lightcurve and $N_f$ is the number of trial frequencies.

For example, \cite{Sesar_et_al_2016} used template fitting to model RR Lyrae in the Pan-STARRS DR1 \citep{PanSTARRS} and found that, 
for a given completeness, template fitting produced purer samples of RR Lyrae than Lomb-Scargle or multi-term extensions \citep{Palmer_2009}.
However, they found that the computational resources needed to produce template fits (approximately 30 minutes per source per CPU), forced
them to
