\abstract{%
  We present a novel, non-linear extension to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram that allows periodograms to be generated
  for arbitrary signal shapes. The computational efficiency of the fast template periodogram improves existing techniques
  by a factor of $\sim$a few for small test cases, and over three orders of magnitude for lightcurves containing
  $\bigO(10^4)$ observations. The fast template periodogram scales asymptotically as $\bigO(HN_f\log HN_f)$, where
  $H$ denotes the number of harmonics required to adequately approximate the template and $N_f$ is the number of trial
  frequencies. Existing implementations scale as $\bigO(N_{\rm obs}N_f)$, where $N_{\rm obs}$ is the number of
  observations in the lightcurve. An open source Python implementation is available on GitHub.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Template fitting, or periodic matched filtering, is a powerful technique for identifying, classifying, and characterizing
periodic variability in noisy time series data. However, template fitting requires several orders of magnitude more computational
resources than running a Lomb Scargle periodogram \cite{Lomb_1976} on the same lightcurve, and the computational requirements scale as 
$N_{\rm obs}N_f$, where $N_{\rm obs}$ is the number of observations in the lightcurve and $N_f$ is the number of trial frequencies.



These conference proceedings, to be edited by M. Catelan and W. Gieren, will be published by the EPJ Web of Conferences. This journal provides open online access to all published papers ({\tt\url{http://www.epj-conferences.org/}}). Please keep in mind the page limits for the different types of contributions: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Invited review papers: 12 pages; 
  \item Invited regular papers: 8 pages; 
  \item Contributed papers: 5 pages; 
  \item Poster papers: 2 pages.  
\end{itemize}  

The figures must be in \lstinline!.pdf! format, and the \lstinline!.tex! file compiled using \lstinline!pdflatex!. The style file supplied with this package must not be edited, under any circumstances! 

If you receive errors when you first attempt to compile the \lstinline!.tex! file, you may want to check if extracting the files contained in \lstinline!additional-styles.tar.gz! into the same directory where you placed your \lstinline!.tex! file solves the problem. If still unsuccessful, you may also need to install the package \lstinline!texlive-fonts-recommended!. 


\section{Some specific instructions}\label{sec:sec-1}
In the following, we provide some additional instructions on how to properly prepare your proceedings contribution. 

\subsection{Figures and tables}\label{sec:figs-tabs}
The typical typesetting for a figure is given in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-1}. In case you want your figure captions to be displayed on the side of the figure, please use the syntax provided along with Figure~\ref{fig:fig-2}. 

\begin{figure*}
\centering
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file. See example above.
% If not, use
\includegraphics[width=10cm,clip]{figure-epjwc.pdf}
\caption{Please write your figure caption here  (standard formatting for the figure and caption).}
\label{fig:fig-1}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure}
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
\centering
\sidecaption
\includegraphics[width=6cm,clip]{figure-epjwc.pdf}
\caption{Please write your figure caption here (figure and caption side-by-side).}
\label{fig:fig-2}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

For tables, please use the syntax of Table~\ref{tab:tab-1}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Please write your table header here.}
% For LaTeX tables you can use
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
first & second & third  \\\hline
number & number & number \\
number & number & number \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:tab-1}       % Give a unique label
\end{table}
%

\subsection{Equations}\label{sec:eqs}
For typesetting equations, you can use the usual commands in \LaTeX. Please keep in mind that equations should read as part of the flow of the text and be punctuated as such. For instance, if you write 

\begin{equation}
- \frac{1}{r^2}
\frac{\partial}{\partial m}\left(16 \pi^2 \Gamma_1 P \rho r^6
\frac{d\eta}{dm}\right)
- 4\pi r \left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial m}\left[(3\Gamma_1-4)P \right]\right\} \eta = 
\sigma^2 \eta,  
\label{eq:lawe}
\end{equation}

\noindent what you have is the linear adiabatic wave equation in Lagrangian form, whereas 

\begin{equation}
- \frac{1}{\rho r^4}
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\Gamma_1 P r^4
\frac{d\eta}{dr}\right)
- \frac{1}{\rho r} \left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left[(3\Gamma_1-4)P \right]\right\} \eta = 
\sigma^2 \eta  
\label{eq:laweeuler}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the same equation, only in Eulerian form. 

To close this section, we emphasize that excessive use of the \lstinline!$! symbol in inline equations is strongly discouraged. For instance, the expression $M_{K} = 0.868 - 2.353 \, \log{P} + 0.175 \, {\rm [Fe/H]}$ should be written thus: \lstinline!$M_{K} = 0.868 - 2.353 \, \log{P} + 0.175 \, {\rm [Fe/H]}$!. 

\subsection{Labels}\label{sec:labels}
Please make sure you use the \lstinline!\label! command in \LaTeX to identify all your sections, subsections, tables, equations, and figures! Each such entry should be given its own, unique label. They should all be cross-referenced within your document using the \lstinline!\ref! command. 

\subsection{Bibliography}\label{sec:biblio}
For the bibliography, please use the same format as in the examples included in this template file. The references should always be cited using the \lstinline!\cite! command. Thus, \lstinline!\cite{RefB1}! produces as output \cite{RefB1}. Citations in parenthetical clauses (\cite{RefPRC1,RefJ1,RefJ2}) use the same format for the \lstinline!\cite! command. 


\section{Submission}\label{sec:summary}
Once your paper is written, please prepare a single compressed file (\lstinline!.gz! or \lstinline!.zip! format) containing all of the files that comprise your contribution (including the \lstinline!.pdf! file resulting from your compilation), and submit it using the web interface that will be available on our web page for this purpose. You are welcome to send a copy of this file to the editors of these proceedings as well. \textbf{Important:} your submission must also include a signed copy of the License Agreement form.\footnote{\tt\url{http://www.epj-conferences.org/doc_journal/copyright/epjconf_copyright.pdf}}
